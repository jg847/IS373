Blade: My takeaways from this project were really getting my feet wet in GitHub again. I used it before for other classes of mine, but those classes were more so focused on 
using them for just uploading files instead of the collaboration efforts that it has. I also learned more about kernels, docker, etc. especially after I was encouraged to have
concern for what theyare as they may come up in my field of work.
